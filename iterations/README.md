# Iteration 1-2:
View improvement & making major access level changes.

The goal is to enable students to log in our site using their github accounts.
We need to do this by adding another access level and change controller logic.
New view(not-editable) is requested for students.
A condensed view for showing collections is also requested. The collections
usually take too much space on a page so it is request to make non-selected 
ones hidden and a button will be used to toggle selections down.

# For Grading and Illustration Purposes:
Hi Tony,
To help you grade our iteration smoothly, we have granted your Github account's access to our Heroku deployment.
You can log in as an instructor to play around the problems/ collections edition functions.
If you want to log in as a student, you can log in using another Github account,
which the system will automatically recognize you as a student.

## Iteration 1-1:
Syncing Forked ruql to SaaS repo. Set up Github Login Key.

The previous group changed some of Prof. Fox's ruql at the end of semester to 
meet their project expectations. Thus, some ugly codes were left here and the ruql
was never accepted to the SaaS repo. Futhermore, Rspecs expectations from that repo
was wrong, and many of cases were not passing.
Our goal is to fix problematic tests, refactor the forked ruql, and merge some of
Prof. Fox latest editions to the on SaaS ruql master repo.

Update: [pull request](https://github.com/saasbook/ruql/pull/16) submitted.
        Pending acceptance from Prof. Fox.

## Iteration 0:
Contact Customer and Environment Set up

This is a legacy code-base project. We need to configure our local, C9, and 
Heorku environment to the correct version and run the project.
